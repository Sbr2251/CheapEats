# CheapEats

This flutter application was built to allow users to purchase left over foods from various cafe's and restaurants. Restaurants will add their leftover foods for the day onto our NoSql Firebase database where users will then be able to see the information on the app. Users will then be able to buy the food on the app and can pick up their food at the store before pickup window closes.  

Since we plan on releasing the app on the appstore, we have withheld some code such as payment setup to maintain security in the app. Approxmate release date for the application is mid summer 2021 with a limited beta to be launched by the end of april. Currently supported locations only include the Dallas Metroplex, but other locations will be added depending on marketing effectiveness and demand.
